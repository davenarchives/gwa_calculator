GWA Calculator in Python (5-Point Scale Only)

Other universities follow a 5-Point Scale, wherein the highest grade is a 1.00 and the lowest is a 5.00 (failing mark). 
The lowest passing mark is actually a 3.00. 
Although usually not depicted, a grade of 4.00 is equivalent to a grade of incomplete. 
If the school does not use the grade point "4.00", it will use "INC" instead.
